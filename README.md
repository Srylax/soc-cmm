# SOC-CMM Web

The SOC-CMM is a tool to assess the maturity of a SOC, [originally created by Rob van Os as Excel tool](https://www.soc-cmm.com/).
It is very impressive and works well, but is an Excel tool after all...
SOC-CMM Web is a web version of the tool, which uses TOML to store the data.

## Issues with the Excel tool

- MS Excel (not a big fan, sorry)
- Doesn't work on Linux (because Excel doesn't, alternatives don't work)
- Slugish (also an Excel issue)

## Features / Improvements of the Web edition

- Modern UI (including dark mode)
- Saved as TOML, which allows tracking progress in a VCS
- Search
- Inline comments
- Bookmarks
